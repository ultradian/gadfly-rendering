stuff on rendering Gadfly to browsers

`juliaK7QmIl.html` is an example plot that was generated by Gadfly

`goodRendering.png` is what it looks like when rendered properly by a browser

`badRendering.png` is what it looks like when it fails (see [issue] (https://github.com/dcjones/Gadfly.jl/issues/797))
