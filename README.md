# gadfly-rendering
stuff on rendering [Gadfly](https://github.com/dcjones/Gadfly.jl) to browsers

`juliaK7QmIl.html` is an example plot that was generated by Gadfly

`goodRendering.png` is what it looks like when rendered properly by a browser

`badRendering.png` is what it looks like when it fails (see [issue] (https://github.com/dcjones/Gadfly.jl/issues/797))

To see what happens in your browser, download the raw version of `juliaK7QmIl.html` and open it up.  If you figure out what makes browser settings makes this happen, document it here!
